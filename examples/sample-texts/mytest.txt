The Windows co-founder is clear that artificial intelligence tools will allow many jobs and processes to be automated, but he is not particularly pessimistic about how such tools can affect people, believing that they will actually help in many areas.

However, he does argue that in the near future there will only be three jobs that will be "immune" to AI, stating that the only ones that will 'resist' this new wave of technology will be energy-related jobs, biology-related positions and all those professionals who specialise in the design and operation of the AI tools themselves. The entrepreneur believes that, by the nature of the three areas, they will be the only ones where humans will not be replaceable.
